## Description

This package provides some RESTful specific components that are useful when building a RESTful api.  These components are used in a [RESTful Plugin for Craft](https://github.com/flipboxfactory/craft-restfult); however they may also be used on their own if you wish to start from scratch.

## Installation

To install, use composer:

```
composer require flipboxfactory/craft-rest
```

## Usage

With this plugin as the scaffolding, you'll need to register and build your own RESTful endpoints.  We've created a [test project as a reference](https://github.com/flipboxlabs/craft-restful-project).


## Testing

``` bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
